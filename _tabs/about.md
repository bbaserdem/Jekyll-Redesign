# About Me

![Thesis Defense Photo](/assets/img/professor_batu.jpg){: w="400" h="400" .left }

My name is Batu, I'm a Physicist/Computational Neuroscientist.

I was born, and lived my early life, in Istanbul Turkey.
I was always interested in Science with a focus on theoretical physics.
I studied theoretical physics in college, and applied for graduate school.
My academic interest lies in the intersection of Neuroscience, Physics, Computer Science and Machine Learning.
Computation on large complex systems fascinate me.

Some topics that interest me are; but in no way an exhaustive list

* Computational Graphs
* Meshless Fluid Mechanics
* AI (Specifically ML and applications)
* Reinforcement Learning
* Group Theory, and Differential Geometry.

Besides my academic interests, I'm an avid open source advocate, and run linux for my personal computers.
One of my passions is scalable coding, and I'm very passionate about the Nix ecosystem.
My Linux OS of choice is Nix, and I willingly chose this life for myself.
I'm an avid music listener, and non-standart tunings with odd time signatures fascinate me.
