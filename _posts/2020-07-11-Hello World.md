I have arrived to the blogosphere!

This blog will most likely be about;

* Computer setup and environment
* Lifestyle
* Research and science
* Creative outlets

# Interest in Computer Setup

My early relationship with computers were mostly about video games and
pirating media that was unavailable to purchase where I lived.
In 2010, I started attending college, and got my first UNIX experience
with a laptop that had macOS Snow Leopard.
I loved the switch from Windows, I really enjoyed the fresh design.
Then I started learning how to code for college.
While I enjoyed coding in MacOS; Apple started moving in directions that made
things less accessible than what I felt like I needed.
I started getting interested in Linux operating systems,
partially because I was seeking *nerd cred*.
Started to use Linux Mint because could not get Ubuntu working at the time.
My biggest success of 2013 was that I managed to triple boot - for 3 weeks
before my configuration failed - Windows 7, OSX Mountain Lion and Linux Mint.
I progressively started using Linux more because it felt frustration free.
I switched to using Linux full time in 2014, and besides occasional dual booting
Windows to play video games, did not look back.
Currently, I'm running Arch Linux as daily driver, and trying to switch to Gentoo.
I have used the following OS's at different points in my life;

* Linux Mint
* Ubuntu
* OpenSUSE
* Manjaro
* Solus
* SteamOS
* Debian
* Arch Linux

After converging on Arch Linux for most of my computer usage;
I started into improving my workflow, and usually trying to improve my
desktop experience.
I try to make my workflow accessible and distributable,
which I believe qualifies as a personal **meta-distro**.
My computer setup section details my journey into organizing such things.

# Lifestyle

I do like sharing my opinions.
I plan on posting every now and then about my personal life,
and how I deal with certain challenges.
Several things that are forefront in my life are;

* Health, mostly about effects of substances and diseases.
* Minimalism, not as a buzzword but as reduction of external interference.
* Climate catastrophe mitigation
* Political opinions and human rights
* Spiritual practices and ideas
* Sports, fitness and mental health

# Research and Science

STEM scientist by training, I enjoy posting about things.
Along with tutorials, I intend to write about;

* Fluid Mechanics
* Manifold Learning
* Neural Networks
* Reinforcement Learning

# Creative Outlets

I have always been an avid worldbuilder;
and aiming to putting my paracosm in some form of media.
Besides that I intend to share some ideas/forays into photography and writing.
